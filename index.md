###Introduction
The Boat is a virtual reality puzzle solving game developed by Yuting Zhang and Jingyi Qu as the
final project for CS498SL Virtual Reality at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
The goal for this project is to provide a playable VR game demo which explores how VR can change 
the field of video games, especially how the human visual and vestibular systems would respond
to this new technology.

###Game Background
_You are on an abandoned ship. Solve puzzles and find your way through this old yet mysterious 
warship._

There are around 10 levels in this game. In some of them, you need to solve puzzles in order to
proceed, and in some of them, you simply need to walk forward and enjoy the unique experience 
virtual reality provides.
